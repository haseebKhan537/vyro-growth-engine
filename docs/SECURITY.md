# Security and Compliance Guardrails

## Data boundary
This repository is a sales/prospecting system. It must not ingest, store, process, or transmit patient PHI.

## Outbound controls
- `OUTBOUND_ENABLED` defaults to `false`.
- No provider adapter may send externally unless the global outbound switch is enabled.
- Suppression checks must happen immediately before every outbound action.
- Permanent unsubscribe records must be durable and honored across campaigns.
- Every external action must create an audit/activity record.

## Voice
Do not implement indiscriminate cold AI robocalling. Voice automation is restricted to inbound leads, requested callbacks, or prospects with documented permission/consent.

## Secrets
- Never commit API keys, passwords, OAuth refresh tokens, SMTP credentials, or private keys.
- Use environment variables or deployment secret stores.
- `.env` is gitignored.
- Loggers must redact credentials and authorization headers.

## Enrichment integrity
- AI-generated prospect facts are not authoritative.
- Store source URLs and confidence/evidence for material enrichment claims.
- Do not use unverifiable claims in personalization.

## Least privilege
Each provider integration should receive only the scopes required for its job. Production service accounts should be separate from personal accounts when possible.

## Separation from billing operations
Future HIPAA/RCM systems must be separate services/data stores with their own controls, access policies, BAAs, and audit requirements. Do not extend this sales database into a patient billing database.
